Your rate limit is determined by the terms of your subscription plan.
To ensure you stay within your rate limit and effectively manage your API usage, there are several methods available:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard">
    One of the most convenient ways to monitor your rate limit is by checking your [dashboard](https://qrapi.app/dashboard).
    It provides a user-friendly interface that displays real-time information about your API usage, including the number of requests made and your remaining rate limit.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check requests header value">
  When making API requests to create QR codes, the response headers include
  valuable information regarding your rate limit. Specifically, the
  "X-Rate-Limit-Limit" header specifies the total number of requests allowed
  within the current rate-limiting period. By inspecting this header in the
  response to your requests, you can easily determine your rate limit.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use dedicated API endpoint">
    We provide a dedicated API endpoint designed to retrieve rate limit details.
    When you make a GET request to this endpoint, it returns valuable information, including the remaining number of QR code creation requests you can make and the expiration date of the current rate-limiting period.
    This endpoint offers programmatic access to your rate limit information, allowing you to automate rate limit monitoring.

    ```
    curl "https://api.qrapi.app/v1/qr/limit" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

By employing these methods, you can effectively monitor your rate limit, stay informed about your API usage, and ensure that your QR code creation requests remain within the defined limits.

If you find that your current rate limit does not meet your needs, consider upgrading your subscription plan.
