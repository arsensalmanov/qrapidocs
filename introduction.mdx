Our API makes it easy to generate QR codes for a variety of purposes, from simple URL redirects to more complex encrypted data. With our API, you can quickly and easily integrate QR code generation into your website or application.

This documentation will guide you through the process of using our API, including how to authenticate your requests, the available endpoints, and the expected responses. You can also use our [Playground](https://qrapi.app/playground) feature to test your requests and see the responses in real-time.

If you have any questions or run into any issues while using our API, please don't hesitate to contact our [support](mailto:support@qrapi.app). We're here to help you get the most out of our QR code creation API!
