## Getting Started with QR API

To use the QR API:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain the API token">
    Register for an API token on the developer
    [dashboard](https://qrapi.app/dashboard).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make an API requests">
    Make a GET or POST request to the `https://api.qrapi.app/v1/qr/create`
    endpoint with your API token and the `text` parameter, which is the text you
    want to encode in the QR code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enjoy your result">
    The API will return the QR code image in the format you specified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## "Hello, World!" example

Here's an example of a request to create a QR code with the data "Hello, World!" in PNG format:

```
curl "https://api.qrapi.app/v1/qr/create?text=Hello%2C+World%21" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

Remember to replace `<API_TOKEN>` with your actual API token.

## Take advantage of interactive playground

To make it easier to integrate the QR API into your application or website, we offer an interactive [playground](https://qrapi.app/playground).
This playground allows you to experiment with different parameters and see the resulting QR codes in real-time.
We highly recommend taking advantage of this feature to ensure that you are using the API to its full potential
and getting the results you need.
