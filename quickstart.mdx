## Getting Started with QR API

To use the QR API:

- Register for an API token on the developer dashboard.
- Make a GET request to the `https://api.qrapi.app/v1/qr/create` endpoint with your API token and the `text` parameter, which is the text you want to encode in the QR code.
- The API will return the QR code image in the format you specified.

## "Hello, World!" example

Here's an example of a request to create a QR code with the data "Hello, World!" in PNG format:

```
https://api.qrapi.app/v1/qr/create?text=Hello%2C+World%21&_token=<API_TOKEN>
```

Remember to replace `<API_TOKEN>` with your actual API token.

## Take advantage of interactive playground

To make it easier to integrate the QR API into your application or website, we offer an interactive [playground](https://qrapi.app/playground).
This playground allows you to experiment with different parameters and see the resulting QR codes in real-time.
We highly recommend taking advantage of this feature to ensure that you are using the API to its full potential
and getting the results you need.
